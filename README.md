### Tweetalyzer - Personal Tweet Analyzer

#### Description
In this assignment I worked on understanding text analytics cognitive services provided by Microsoft Azure.
Text Analytics service provides advanced natural language processing for raw unstructured text. It includes four main functions: sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, and entity linking. For this assignment I used only the sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction features.
70% of the code is logic I infused and hand-written code.

#### Difficulties
Working with ```matplotlib``` for graphing was more challenging than I anticipated and took hour to figure out. Documentation online was not easy to follow or sometimes was non-existent/not updated.
I initially wanted to be able to do something with retrieving tweets within a certain time frame, but the twitter API is very limiting and does not allow for this which forced me to change directions.
Also the fact that I did not follow any specific tutorial (as the initial tutorial I found that inspired me to analyze tweets was not something I could submit), made structuring the project a little bit tough as things were constantly changing along the way as I discovered ideas were not as feasible.
